# How search works

Search resolves an input `{ companyText, roleText, skillNames, experienceYears, projectTexts?, sort? }` to a ranked list of **job cards** (`JobCard[]`). Each card is one real scraped job; its interview rounds are parsed at read time from the job's `focusRoundPattern`.

The model has three parts:

1. **Candidate set (a union).** Role (title), company, and skills each *bring jobs in*. A job qualifies if it matches **any** of them. Experience is the one hard filter — out-of-band jobs are excluded. Projects only **score** candidates; they do not add new ones.
2. **Match % (an equal blend).** Each job is scored on up to two sub-scores — **skills%** and **projects%** — averaged into one headline %. Experience is *not* scored.
3. **Sort.** `default` ("Best match") tiers results **company → role → skill**: a searched company's jobs come first (even at 0% match), then role matches from other companies, then skill-only matches — each tier ranked internally by match %. `score` ("Match score") ignores the tier and ranks purely by match %.

All matchers live in [`lib/search.ts`](../lib/search.ts).

## Data model

```prisma
model Company { id, name @unique, jobs Job[] }

model Job {
  id, companyId
  jobTitle, requiredSkills?, roleSummary?, roleType?, ...
  focusRoundPattern   // "Opening/Screening + Technical/Role Skills + Final/Culture Fit"
  experienceMinYears?, experienceMaxYears?
  embedding vector(512)?   // composite title+roleType+summary+skills, queried via $queryRaw
}
```

Rounds are **not stored as rows**. `focusRoundPattern` is a `+`-separated string; [`parseRounds()`](../lib/rounds.ts) splits it into an ordered list at read time against a closed 7-segment vocabulary (unknown segments fall back to `Other`). `roundCount` on a card is just that list's length.

---

## Layer 1: normalize

```ts
function normalize(text: string): string {
  return text.trim().toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9\s+#./-]/g, "");
}
```

- Lowercases, trims, strips punctuation that isn't meaningful in tech names. We keep `+`, `#`, `.`, `/`, `-` so `C++`, `C#`, `Next.js`, `CI/CD` survive.
- The normalized string feeds the exact lookup and the embedder. The trigram operator gets the **raw** text because `pg_trgm` is case-insensitive anyway.

---

## Title matching — `matchTitleIds(roleText)`

Runs **all three tiers and unions their ids** into a `Set`. A generic query like `"Software Engineer"` should surface both the exact title and related real titles, so we union the tiers rather than stopping at the first hit. Each tier is capped at `MAX_TITLE_MATCHES_PER_TIER = 20`. Title only decides **membership** (it never ranks the final list — the blended match % does), so each tier selects **ids only**; the per-tier similarity stays in `ORDER BY` purely to pick the top 20.

**Tier 1 — exact:**
```sql
SELECT id FROM "Job" WHERE lower("jobTitle") = $norm LIMIT 20
```

**Tier 2 — trigram** (floor `MIN_TITLE_TRIGRAM_SIMILARITY = 0.3`):
```sql
SELECT id FROM "Job"
WHERE "jobTitle" % $text AND similarity("jobTitle", $text) >= 0.3
ORDER BY similarity("jobTitle", $text) DESC LIMIT 20
```

**Tier 3 — vector** (top 20 nearest by cosine):
```sql
SELECT id FROM "Job"
WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL ORDER BY embedding <=> $vec::vector LIMIT 20
```

> The vector tier has **no similarity floor of its own** — it always returns the 20 nearest. Returns the unioned ids (`titleIds`); the similarity/cosine only orders each tier's `LIMIT`, it is never returned or scored. Empty `roleText` → `[]`.

### How trigrams work
```
"Google"  → {"  G"," Go","Goo","oog","ogl","gle","le "}
"googl"   → {"  g"," go","goo","oog","ogl","gl "}
shared {"goo","oog","ogl"} → similarity ≈ 0.5
```
The GIN trigram index (`job_title_trgm`) makes `WHERE "jobTitle" % $text` an index lookup (~3ms) instead of a seq scan. Catches typos (`"engneer"`), variants, and partials (`"front"` → `Frontend Engineer`). Misses strings with no shared 3-grams (`"SDE"` ↔ `"Software Engineer"`) — that's what the vector tier is for.

### The embedding model
[`lib/embeddings.ts`](../lib/embeddings.ts) uses `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` via the AWS Bedrock API:
- 512-dim, normalized (cosine-ready unit vectors)
- Requires `AWS_REGION` env var; credentials resolve from the standard AWS chain
- Query embeddings are wrapped in an LRU cache (`max: 500`) keyed on the lowercased text, so a repeated role/project string is embedded once then served from memory.

Job embeddings are computed at import time over a **composite** of the posting, not the title alone (see [`prisma/import-jobs.ts`](../prisma/import-jobs.ts)):
```ts
`${job_title}. ${role_type}. ${role_summary}. Skills: ${required_skills}`
```

---

## Company matching — `matchCompanyIds(companyText)`

Company names are typed near-exact (proper nouns), so this matcher is a simple **exact → trigram waterfall with no vector tier**, returning at most **5** company ids:

```ts
// Tier 1: exact — return immediately if found
SELECT id FROM "Company" WHERE lower(name) = $norm LIMIT 5;

// Tier 2: trigram — accept only if top score clears the floor
SELECT id, similarity(name, $text) AS score FROM "Company"
WHERE name % $text ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 5;
// keep only if score[0] >= MIN_COMPANY_TRIGRAM_SIMILARITY (0.4)
```

`MIN_COMPANY_TRIGRAM_SIMILARITY = 0.4` is strict because company names are short and false positives are costly. A miss returns `[]`.

---

## The empty-result guard

```ts
if (titleMatches.length === 0 && companyIds.length === 0 && skills.length === 0) return [];
```

If nothing was typed (or nothing matched), search returns an empty list instead of dumping the whole `Job` table. At least one of title / company / skills must produce a constraint.

---

## Final query — union, blend, floor/backfill (one CTE pipeline)

One `$queryRaw` over `Job JOIN Company`. The experience band is a hard filter; everything else is **OR-ed into a union**. The sub-scores, the blend, the per-tier floor, and the final order/limit are **all in SQL** — so a 30-row `LIMIT` is a correct top-N by match % (the JS side is just a row→card mapper).

```sql
WITH raw AS (          -- union candidate set + raw counts/cosine + tier flag
  SELECT j.*, c.name,
    CASE WHEN $hasSkills THEN cov.matched ELSE NULL END               AS matched,
    cov.required,
    CASE WHEN $hasProjVecs AND j.embedding IS NOT NULL
         THEN (SELECT MAX((1 - (j.embedding <=> pv::vector))::float)
               FROM unnest($projVecLits::text[]) AS pv)
         ELSE NULL END                                                AS "projSim",
    CASE WHEN company ∈ companyIds THEN 0                             -- tier:
         WHEN job ∈ titleIds       THEN 1                             --  0 company
         ELSE 2 END                                          AS tier  --  1 role / 2 skill
  FROM "Job" j JOIN "Company" c ON c.id = j."companyId"
  CROSS JOIN LATERAL ( -- over j.requiredSkills split on , ; |
    --   matched  = job skill tokens covered by any input skill  (ILIKE substring)
    --   required = count of non-empty job skill tokens
  ) cov
  WHERE ( $experienceYears IS NULL
          OR $experienceYears BETWEEN COALESCE(min,0) AND COALESCE(max,99) )  -- hard filter
    AND ( job ∈ titleIds OR company ∈ companyIds
       OR cov.matched > 0 )                                                    -- UNION
),
sub AS (    SELECT *, skillsPct, projectsPct FROM raw ),     -- see Scoring below
scored AS ( SELECT *, score = mean(non-null [skillsPct, projectsPct]) FROM sub ),
ranked AS ( SELECT *,
              ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY tier
                                 ORDER BY score DESC NULLS LAST, "createdAt") AS rn_in_tier
            FROM scored ),
pick AS (   SELECT * FROM ranked          -- SELECTION (which 30)
            ORDER BY CASE WHEN $sort='default' THEN              -- company first,
                       CASE WHEN tier = 0 THEN 0                 -- then floor 15 of
                            WHEN rn_in_tier <= 15 THEN 1         -- role/skill, then
                            ELSE 2 END                           -- backfill by score
                       ELSE 0 END,
                     score DESC NULLS LAST, "createdAt"
            LIMIT 30 )                                                        -- MAX_RESULTS
SELECT *, (tier < 2) AS "roleOrCompanyMatched"  -- DISPLAY order
FROM pick
ORDER BY CASE WHEN $sort='default' THEN tier ELSE 0 END,
         score DESC NULLS LAST, "createdAt";
```

### Candidate set (which jobs qualify) — a union, not an AND
A job enters the set if it matches **any** signal:

- **Role** — `j.id ∈ titleIds` from `matchTitleIds` (exact ∪ trigram ∪ vector).
- **Company** — `j."companyId" ∈ companyIds` from `matchCompanyIds`.
- **Skills** — `matched > 0`: the job shares ≥1 of the typed skills.

Typing a role therefore **also** surfaces skill-matched jobs that don't match the role. **Experience is the only hard filter**: the typed years must fall inside the job's `[min, max]` band (null input → disabled; null job bounds → open-ended `0`/`99`). Experience is never scored or shown. `tier` records how a job qualified — `0` company, `1` role, `2` skill-only — and drives the default sort and the floor. The card/return shape still carries `roleOrCompanyMatched`, now derived as `tier < 2`.

---

## Scoring — the blended match % (computed in SQL)

The headline `score` is the **equal mean** of whichever sub-scores apply — no weights ([`lib/search.ts`](../lib/search.ts), the `sub`/`scored` CTEs).

### Skills% (`skillsPct`)
```
coverage  = (job skill tokens covered by an input skill) / (job's skill-token count)
skillsPct = round(coverage × 100)            // e.g. 5/7 → 71
```
Both sides are normalized (lowercased, non-alphanumerics stripped) and matched as a substring against the job's `,`/`;`/`|`-split tokens, so `"node.js"` matches `"NodeJS"`. No skills typed → `skillsPct` null.

### Projects% (`projectsPct`) — semantic, per-project
Only scored when the resume has project keywords (extracted by LLM at parse time, see [`PROJECT_BASED_RETRIEVAL.md`](./PROJECT_BASED_RETRIEVAL.md)). Each project's keyword string is embedded separately via Bedrock Titan; `projSim` is the MAX cosine across all project vectors for that job:

```
projSim     = MAX cosine(job.embedding, projVecLits[i])   for i in projects
projectsPct = round( clamp( (projSim - 0.40) / 0.60, 0, 1 ) × 100 )
```

`MIN_PROJECT_SIMILARITY = 0.40` filters Titan's background noise (~0.10–0.20 for unrelated texts). No project keywords → `projectsPct` null (projectless candidates aren't penalized).

### Blend
```
score = round( mean( non-null [skillsPct, projectsPct] ) )
```
Both null → `score` null → badge `—`. The card hover shows the `Skills%` / `Projects%` breakdown behind the headline.

---

## Sort modes — company → role → skill, with the 15-floor / backfill

The blend is the SQL `ORDER BY` key, so each mode `LIMIT 30` correctly. The UI toggle (`Best match` / `Match score`) re-runs the search with the chosen mode.

- **`default` (Best match):** three tiers in order — **company (0) → role (1) → skill (2)**.
  - *Company tier* is shown **in full and first**, even at 0% match: searching a company means you see that company's roles. (A role+company job counts as company.)
  - *Role and skill tiers* are each **guaranteed up to `MIN_SLOTS_PER_TIER = 15` slots** of whatever the company tier didn't consume, then the list **backfills toward 30** by score. So 40 role + 3 skill → 27 role + 3 skill (skill floor honored, role backfills); 3 role + 40 skill → 3 role + 27 skill.
  - *Display*: by tier (company, then role, then skill), each ordered by `score`.
- **`score` (Match score):** pure `score DESC` top-30, tier ignored — a higher-scoring non-company job can top the list.

> Worked example: searching role "Engineer" + company "VakilSearch". `default` → VakilSearch's jobs first (company tier, even at low match), then other companies' engineer jobs by score, then skill-only. `score` → ordered purely by match %, VakilSearch not floated.

The thin JS mapper then parses `focusRoundPattern` into rounds and maps `experienceMinYears` to a display `seniority` via `deriveSeniority` (`≤2 entry`, `≤6 mid`, else `senior`) — no re-sorting (SQL already ordered + limited).

## Limits at a glance

| Stage | Limit | Constant |
|---|---|---|
| Title tier — exact / trigram / vector (each) | 20 | `MAX_TITLE_MATCHES_PER_TIER` |
| Company tier — exact / trigram (each) | 5 | literal |
| Best-match floor — slots guaranteed for role & skill tiers | 15 | `MIN_SLOTS_PER_TIER` |
| Final list returned / displayed (and SQL `LIMIT`) | 30 | `MAX_RESULTS` |

Retrieval equals display: the query computes the blend in SQL and `LIMIT 30`s directly — there is no oversized candidate pool. Under `default`, the company tier is shown first in full, then the role and skill tiers are each guaranteed up to 15 of the remaining slots before backfilling toward 30. Role backfill is in turn bounded by how many ids the title tiers yield (≤20 each).

## What the inputs mean

| Input | Candidate set | Score | Order (default) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Accenture` | Accenture jobs (company tier) | badge `—` (no skills) | company tier, then recency |
| `SDE` | title matches **∪** any skill/project matches | skills/projects where present | role tier first |
| `[React, Node.js]` | jobs sharing ≥1 skill | coverage % (+ projects if resume) | by blended % |
| `SDE` + `[React]` + `3 yrs` | title ∪ skill matches, band-filtered | React coverage (+ projects) | role tier first, then % |
| `SDE` + `Accenture` | title ∪ Accenture ∪ skill matches | skills/projects where present | Accenture jobs first, then role, then skill |
| resume w/ projects | (no extra candidates) | skills% **and** projects% blended | role tier first, then % |
| nothing | — | — | `[]` (guard) |

## Indexes ([`prisma/db-init.sql`](../prisma/db-init.sql))

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm; CREATE EXTENSION vector;

CREATE INDEX job_title_trgm    ON "Job"     USING GIN ("jobTitle" gin_trgm_ops);
CREATE INDEX job_skills_trgm   ON "Job"     USING GIN ("requiredSkills" gin_trgm_ops);
CREATE INDEX company_name_trgm ON "Company" USING GIN (name gin_trgm_ops);
CREATE INDEX job_embedding_hnsw ON "Job"
  USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);

-- DB-level dedup: one Job per (company, case-folded title)
ALTER TABLE "Job" ADD COLUMN dedup_key text
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS ("companyId" || '|' || lower(btrim("jobTitle"))) STORED;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX job_dedup_key_uniq ON "Job" (dedup_key);
```

HNSW is the approximate-nearest-neighbour index for the vector tier and the project semantic fallback (~10ms lookups). The generated `dedup_key` + unique index enforce one job per company/title at the DB level; the importer also dedups upstream, keeping the row with the richest round pattern.
